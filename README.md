# FPS Sample: The Inspection - Lightmapping demo

This little diorama scene demonstrate usage of realtime and baked lighting within the context of Universal Render Pipeline.

It employs a combination of assets mainly from [FPS Sample](https://unity.com/fps-sample) and from [Snaps Art HD - Sci-fi Military Base pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/snaps-art-hd-sci-fi-military-base-158105). All assets were originally thought for HD Render Pipeline and have been remixed to fit URP's workflows.

Originally made to go with the Unite Now talk "Harnessing Light with URP and the GPU Lightmapper".
